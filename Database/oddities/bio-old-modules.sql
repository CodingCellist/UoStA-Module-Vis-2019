	, "This module provides an introduction to cell, molecular and developmental biology as well as genetics. The coursemodule starts by examining the components of a cell and how they are studied. Nerve cell specialisation and function are given particular consideration. After an introduction to molecular genetics, we continue with Mendelian, chromosomal and linkage genetics before considering how an organism develops from a single cell. An overview of molecular biology is followed by a discussion of energy generation in cells. Practicals centre on the use of microscopy in cell biology and provide an opportunity to engage in a project according to individual interests."

	, "This module provides an introduction to the basic systems that underlie the enormous diversity of living organisms as well as reviewing some of that diversity. The original home of all life was in the sea, but some of the most interesting and dramatic changes to organisms have occurred in those groups that have adapted to a terrestrial life. Starting with the origin of life, we will consider how it evolved in the sea, and then how plants and animals made the move to land and the adaptations that have enabled them to survive and reproduce in various habitats. The subject of animal behaviour will be introduced, as it has a crucial role in the interactions between animals and their environment. The interaction between the environment, hormones and behaviour in the reproduction of animals will also be discussed. The course finishes with lectures on the principles of ecology that underlie the diversity and the pattern of adaptations of organisms. Practical work will be on both plant and animal material, and will introduce a variety of techniques."

It covers our evolution as a species, the basic structure and functions of our bodies, the ways in which we survive on this planet, the organisms which use us for their own survival, and the ways in which we think, communicate, reproduce and eventually die. This module is designed to be accessible to students with or without a background in biology."

The module surveys the animal kingdom, describing the key groups and the defining characteristics of their body plans and lifestyles, while putting this in an evolutionary context to reveal the patterns and trends in the kingdom as a whole. Special topics that are of fundamental importance to animals, such as animal communication, and the mechanisms of locomotion on land and in the sea and air, are considered in more detail. An extensive series of practical exercises reinforces and complements the lecture component of this module."

The module will further develop the understanding and application of techniques, skills and concepts, which are integral to the revolution that has occurred in the biological sciences in recent years. The module is essential underpinning for all branches of modern biology and biochemistry. The lectures include coursework on biological molecular architecture, cellular architecture, enzymes & metabolism, genomics and conclude with an introduction to the molecular basis of infection and immunity. The laboratory element will develop practical skills and the use of bioinformatics resources."

The principles of Ecology and Evolution have determined the variety and distribution of all organisms and will determine their future responses to global change. This module will introduce students to principles and patterns of Ecology, ranging from the global (for example, patterns of energy flow through ecosystems and the biogeography of organisms and communities) to the individual (competition between and within species) and the history and processes of Evolutionary Biology (Darwin, natural selection, population genetics, the evolution of sex and speciation)."

Initial comparisons relating to scaling and design of animals will be followed by more specific units on: (A) Comparative principles of ionic and osmotic exchanges; water balance in aquatic and land animals, adaptations at skin, kidney, and respiratory surfaces. (B) Respiratory systems in water and on land, and associated circulatory mechanisms. (C) Principles of temperature balance; ectotherms and endotherms. (D) Feeding and digestive systems; food collection, ingestion, and absorption at different trophic levels; and waste disposal. (E) Sensory systems in different environments (especially visual, olfactory, auditory, and special senses).
